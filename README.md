# Targa-UI-Challenge

This project was done at the Code Red Hackathon in Houston, TX. The project uses animation and probability to simulate real life pipelines carrying resources to allow users to make better decisions with their lines. The data and visuals give users a snapshot of up to the minute operations across the country.
